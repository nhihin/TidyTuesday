## Analysis Part 1 - The Bechdel Test Over Time

- Let's try to reproduce the following plot from the [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/). 

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hickey-bechdel-11.png?w=1220)

- The scoring seems to be coming from the `test` (or `clean_test`) in the `movies` data.

```{r}
movies$clean_test %>% unique()
```

- The histogram below shows that each year, there are more movies. 

```{r}
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, fill = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("The Bechdel Test Over Time")
```

- In the FiveThirtyEight plot, they bin the years, and show the values as percentages rather than exact values. Let's try to do this. First, we set the `breaks` accordingly. 

```{r}
# Adapted from https://www.jdatalab.com/data_science_and_data_mining/2017/01/30/data-binning-plot.html
# set up cut-off values 
breaks <- c(1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013)

# specify interval/bin labels
tags <- c("[1970-1974)",
          "[1975-1979)",
          "[1980-1984)", 
          "[1985-1989)",
          "[1990-1994)",
          "[1995-1999)",
          "[2000-2004)",
          "[2005-2009)",
          "[2010-2013)")

# bucketing values into bins
group_tags <- cut(movies$year, 
                  breaks=breaks, 
                  include.lowest=TRUE, 
                  right=FALSE, 
                  labels=tags)

# inspect bins
summary(group_tags)

# order factor
movies$year_bin <- factor(group_tags, 
               levels = tags,
               ordered = TRUE)
```

- I'm also going to reorder the `clean_test` so that it matches the FiveThirtyEight plot.

```{r}
movies$clean_test %<>% factor(levels = c("ok", "dubious", "men", "notalk", "nowomen"))
```

- Redo the bar plot for the bins, and change position to fill in order to make it show percentages (see https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/48-grouped-barplot-with-ggplot2.html). 

```{r}
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year_bin, fill = forcats::fct_rev(clean_test))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "white")+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("[1970-1974)" = "1970-74",
                              "[1975-1979)" = "",
                              "[1980-1984)" = "1980-84", 
                              "[1985-1989)" = "",
                              "[1990-1994)" = "1990-94",
                              "[1995-1999)" = "",
                              "[2000-2004)" = "2000-04",
                              "[2005-2009)" = "",
                              "[2010-2013)" = "2010-13")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Percentage (%)", fill = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), 
                     labels = c("0", "25", "50", "75", "100")) +
  ggtitle("The Bechdel Test Over Time",
          subtitle = "How women are represented in movies") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ff2600", "#ff937f", "#ffcac0", "#6ab2d5", "#008fd5"),
                    labels = c("ok"="Passes Bechdel Test",
                                 "dubious"="Dubious",
                                 "men"="Women only talk about men",
                                 "notalk"="Women don't talk to each other",
                                 "nowomen"="Fewer than two women"))

```

## Analysis Part 2 - Median Budget for Films

- Also trying to recreate this plot: 

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hickey-bechdel-2.png?w=1220)

- The `budget_2013` variable makes it simple as this contains dollars which have already been adjusted to be in 2013 dollars as the FiveThirtyEight plot shows. 

- We will prepare a summarised data.frame that contains the median of `budget_2013` across all films in each category of the Bechdel Test result stored in `clean_test`. 

```{r}
movies_summary <- movies %>%
  dplyr::group_by(clean_test) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(median_budget_2013 = median(budget_2013)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(label = case_when(
    clean_test == "ok" ~ "Passes Bechdel Test",
    clean_test == "dubious" ~ "Dubious",
    clean_test == "men" ~ "Women only talk about men",
    clean_test == "notalk" ~ "Women don't talk to each other",
    clean_test == "nowomen" ~ "Fewer than two women"
  )) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(median_budget_2013_M = median_budget_2013 / 1e6)

```

- The bar plot can now be plotted as follows:

```{r fig.width=11}
movies_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_budget_2013_M, y = label)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(x = "millions of dollars", y = "") +
  ggtitle("Median Budget for Films Since 1990", 
          subtitle = "2013 dollars")
```


## Analysis Part 3 - Sankey Plot (Incomplete)

- This part of the analysis comes from Jodi, who showcased a very interesting and effective use of Sankey plots in the Slack channel. 

```{r}
nodes <- movies$clean_test %>% 
  unique() %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  set_colnames("name") %>%
  tibble::rowid_to_column("node")


```
