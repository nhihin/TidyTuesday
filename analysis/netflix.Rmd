## Background

The dataset for this week's TidyTuesday relates to Netflix shows/movies and 
their directors and cast. More info in the links below:

- https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-04-20/readme.md
- https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv

- From the Kaggle page, they have the following suggestions for exploring 
the data.

<blockquote>
Inspiration

Some of the interesting questions (tasks) which can be performed on this 
dataset: 

Understanding what content is available in different countries
Identifying similar content by matching text-based features
Network analysis of Actors / Directors and find interesting insights
Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
</blockquote>

- I'm going to try to explore the network analysis of actors/directors. 


## Import Data

- The data contains a range of years, but as I'm on a macbook, building a 
network is slow with the full dataset. I am subsetting the data based on 
the past 5 years.

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 17)

netflix_titles <- tuesdata$netflix

netflix_titles$release_year %>% unique()

netflix_titles %<>%
  dplyr::filter(release_year %in% c(2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021))

```

- First we need to get the data into long form as follows. There is probably 
a quicker way of doing this but it works OK for now. 
(Edit: use `separate_rows` in future.)

```{r}
netflix_titles_long <- netflix_titles %>%
  dplyr::select(show_id, title, director, cast)%>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(director)) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(cast = cast %>% strsplit(., split = ", ")) %>%
  tidyr::unnest_longer(col = cast) %>%
  ungroup()

head(netflix_titles_long)
```

## Nodes and Edges Tables

- From the long version of the data, we can prepare node and edge tables 
which can then be imported into Gephi for visualisation. 

- Note: `igraph` is also apparently good for network visualisation within R 
but I have not used it yet! Will come back to try to reimplement in igraph 
another time. 

### Nodes table

- The intention is to make a heterogenous/mixed network where we
want the nodes to represent: ID of movie, director, cast. 
This means that each of these will be a row in the nodes table. 

- I will also join the movie titles on there as well in case we need them for
visualisation purposes later. 

```{r}
nodes <- data.frame(
  Id = c(unique(netflix_titles_long$show_id), 
         unique(netflix_titles_long$director),
         unique(netflix_titles_long$cast)) 
) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(NodeType = c(rep("Show", length(unique(netflix_titles_long$show_id))),
                         rep("Director", length(unique(netflix_titles_long$director))),
                         rep("Cast", length(unique(netflix_titles_long$cast)))
                         )) %>%
  left_join(netflix_titles_long[, c("show_id", "title")], 
            by = c("Id"="show_id")) %>%
  dplyr::rename(Label = title) %>%
  dplyr::distinct(Id, Label, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Label = gsub(x = Label, pattern = "#", replacement = "")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Id))
```



### Edges Table

- The edges represent connections, in this case, we will plot the following 
edges on the network:

  - show_id to director: Indicates director directed a movie
  - show_id to cast: Indicates cast involved in a movie
  - director to cast: Indicates director working with cast
  
- The structure of the edges table should include the `Source` and `Target` 
columns for import into Gephi.

```{r}
showIdToDirector <- netflix_titles_long %>%
  dplyr::select(show_id, director) %>%
  dplyr::distinct(show_id, director) %>%
  set_colnames(c("Source", "Target"))

showIdToCast <- netflix_titles_long %>%
  dplyr::select(show_id, cast) %>%
  dplyr::distinct(show_id, cast) %>%
  set_colnames(c("Source", "Target"))

directorToCast <- netflix_titles_long %>%
  dplyr::select(director, cast) %>%
  dplyr::distinct(director, cast) %>%
  set_colnames(c("Source", "Target"))

edges <- bind_rows(showIdToDirector,
                   showIdToCast,
                   directorToCast) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Source), !is.na(Target))

```

## Export Node and Edge tables for Gephi

```{r}
nodes %>% readr::write_csv(here("output", "nodes2.csv"))
edges %>% readr::write_csv(here("output", "edges2.csv"))
```

## Gephi Network Analysis steps

- This has essentially been adapted from this tutorial: http://www.martingrandjean.ch/gephi-introduction/

- Import both the nodes and edges tables into Gephi using `File > Import Spreadsheet`. 

- In the importing options, I set the graph as being `undirected` and chose to merge 
both spreadsheets into a new workspace. 

- I set colours according to the `NodeType` column we made in the nodes table, and size 
according to Degree (i.e. number of nodes that each node is connected to).

- For laying out the graph, I applied "Random Layout", followed by 
"Force Atlas 2" (initial layout), and "Yifan Hu" to increase the visual separation 
of the nodes a bit more. 

- The final result!
